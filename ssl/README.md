I've used the following links:

- **Creates an HTTPs server** http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13186134/node-js-express-and-heroku-how-to-handle-http-and-https
- **Create certificates** http://blog.nategood.com/client-side-certificate-authentication-in-ngi

> The provided certificates in the *dev* folder have the passphrase **test**. When running *foreman start* you are asked for that passphrase.
