# base app
==
This is a starting point app with NodeJS, MongoDB, AngularJS and Bootstrap.

In the *views/index.html* file replace 

	ga('create', '**XXXXXXX-INSERT-YOUR-ANALITICS-ID-XXXXXX**', '**www.yoursite.com**');

with your app info (if you need Analytics; otherwise remove the script).

Configure the *config/index.js* file with your mongo DB endpoint
